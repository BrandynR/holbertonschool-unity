# 0x0C. Unity - AR Slingshot Game

In this project you will create a “slingshot” game in which the application will detect a horizontal plane (like the floor or a table) and generate moving targets on top of the plane. The user can then launch projectiles to hit the targets for points, creating interaction between a screen and the user’s physical space.

This project will utilize Unity’s AR Foundation 3.0.1 and Unity 2019.3 or later. You must install both the ARKit XR Unity plugin and the ARCore XR Unity plugin in order to create both iOS and Android builds for review.

You are strongly encouraged to read through all the tasks before starting the project. Reading all the mandatory tasks and whiteboarding the flow of the application will help your development process immensely.

## Requirements for Unity projects
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
