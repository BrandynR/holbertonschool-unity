This repo is attempt at full functional Tetris clone. Complete with a pause/restart menu, music and sound effects, and the ability to hold a piece off to the side and call it back, this clone is updated remix of the 80's classic.


# Original Project Guidelines

**This project is optional!**  While the AR / VR track focuses on 3D projects, you can also develop 2D projects in Unity and many of the concepts in programming for 2D and 3D games are the same.

## Requirements

### General

-   A  `README.md`  file, at the root of the folder of the project
-   Use Unityâ€™s default  `.gitignore`  in your  `holbertonschool-unity`  directory
-   Push the entire project folder  `2D-clone`  to your repo
-   In your scripts, all your public classes and their members should have XML documentation tags
-   In your scripts, all your private classes and members should be documented but without XML documentation tags

#### 0. Classic clones  #advanced

In Unity, create a 2D clone of one of the following classic games:

-   Galaga
-   Tetris
-   Pac-Man
-   Super Mario Bros.

Things to consider including in your game:

-   Start menu
-   Pause menu
-   Score / High score leaderboard

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to move a game piece left, right, or down. 
- Up Arrow to rotate a game piece.
- '/' to change to the rotation direction.
- 'Right Shift' to hold a game piece off to the side, or to recall that piece.
